# NodeServer 🚀

Welcome to my Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB learning project! This repository serves as a practical playground for honing my skills in these technologies while using Docker to containerize the environment 🤓

## Project Overview 📋

In this project, I'm gonna explore the fundamentals of Node.js, harness the power of Express to build a RESTful API, utilize TypeScript for type-safe development, and integrate MongoDB as the database. 

## Getting Started 🚀

To run on this on your machine make sure you have the following:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
or
- Node.js: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Mongo db 


Once you have the prerequisites ready, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hermey1/nodeserver
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd nodeserver
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up or make up
   ```

4. Your Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB development environment is up and running! if you don't have docker you can run yarn/npm install to start the project. Youll need to have mongo and redis install on your machine. You can avoid all this hustle by using docker.

## Project Structure 📂

This project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains your TypeScript source code.
- `dist/`: The compiled JavaScript code.


Feel free to explore the source code, make changes, and experiment with the different aspects of Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB.

## Learning Objectives 📖

- Understand the basics of Node.js and asynchronous programming.
- Learn how to create RESTful APIs with Express.
- Gain familiarity with TypeScript for static typing and enhanced code quality.
- Explore MongoDB as a NoSQL database solution.
